# JudgeGauge

**JudgeGauge is a fail-closed calibration gate for teams using LLMs as judges, preventing expensive evaluations from running when the judge itself is too unstable to support the intended conclusion.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Terminal recording coming before the first public release. It will show installation, a failed gate, and the generated HTML report.

## 60-Second Quickstart

JudgeGauge currently supports an OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint and reads `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`, and `OPENAI_BASE_URL`. The model defaults to `gpt-5-mini` and the base URL defaults to OpenAI's API.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yunaremaia/JudgeGauge.git
judgegauge gate --smoke
```

Or use the Python API with any callable that follows the `Judge` protocol:

```python
import judgegauge

judgegauge.calibrate().require()
```

The bounded smoke suite makes nine requests and measures same-window repeat ranking, candidate-order sensitivity, and invalid readouts. It does **not** certify cross-day stability, correctness, or agreement with humans.

## Reports

```bash
judgegauge gate --smoke --format json --output judgegauge.json
judgegauge gate --smoke --format sarif --output judgegauge.sarif
judgegauge gate --smoke --format html --output judgegauge.html
```

Exit `0` means the frozen smoke gates passed, `1` means calibration completed but failed, and `2` means the gate could not be evaluated. Unparseable readouts fail closed.

## GitHub Action

Until the first tagged release, pin the action to a commit SHA in production. For early testing:

```yaml
jobs:
  judge-calibration:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: DaBestCode/JudgeGauge@main
        env:
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

Make expensive evaluation jobs depend on `judge-calibration` with `needs:`. The reusable action
installs JudgeGauge from the selected Git revision, writes `judgegauge-report.json`, and preserves the
CLI's fail-closed exit codes. See the [complete workflow](examples/github-actions.yml).

## GitHub Actions

```yaml
jobs:
  judge-calibration:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: DaBestCode/JudgeGauge@main
        env:
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}

  expensive-evaluation:
    needs: judge-calibration
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: python -m my_project.evaluate
```

Pin a release tag rather than `main` after the first release. The action writes
`judgegauge-report.json` by default and propagates JudgeGauge's fail-closed exit code.

## Old Way vs. JudgeGauge

| Concern | Old Way / Fragile DIY | Using JudgeGauge |
|---|---|---|
| Repeatability | Assume temperature zero is deterministic | Measure repeated rankings in the current window |
| Position bias | Shuffle candidates informally | Run paired exact-order reversals |
| Invalid output | Retry until parsing succeeds | Retain invalid readouts as gate failures |
| Model identity | Log only the requested model | Record requested and response-side model identifiers |
| CI behavior | Discover instability after the full evaluation | Exit non-zero before downstream work |
| Reporting | Mix API health with scientific validity | State the verdict and its scope limits separately |

## Why This Exists

A preregistered audit of 52,988 request attempts reported same-window repeat rankings at Spearman `0.400` against a required `0.90`, and byte-identical next-day replay agreement of `0.78` against `0.99`, despite clean delivery, schema validity, and request hashes. Its practical conclusion is narrow: a model name on a shared endpoint is not automatically a frozen measurement instrument.

## Current Scope

Version `0.1.0` is the first vertical slice:

- Built-in same-window smoke suite
- OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions adapter
- Custom Python judge protocol
- Text, JSON, SARIF, and standalone HTML reports
- Fail-closed CLI exit codes

Cross-day sealed baselines, framework adapters, GitHub Actions packaging, richer provenance logs, and statistically calibrated task-specific batteries remain roadmap work. Live endpoint validation is tracked in [issue #1](https://github.com/DaBestCode/JudgeGauge/issues/1); the default test suite remains keyless.

## Development

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
python -m unittest discover -s tests
ruff check .
```
